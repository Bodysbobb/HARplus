Description: HARplus is an advanced package for processing GEMPACK `.HAR` and `.SL4` files, 
    designed to streamline large-scale economic modeling workflows. It extends beyond 
    traditional `.HAR` readers by offering efficient data extraction, structured metadata 
    management, and flexible data transformations. The package supports multi-file analysis, 
    subtotal level handling, dimension renaming, and optimized memory usage to ensure seamless 
    handling of complex datasets. Unlike standard `.HAR` readers, HARplus enables advanced 
    manipulations such as pivoting, renaming dimensions, exporting to multiple formats, 
    and cross-comparing structured data across different sources. The package is fully 
    independent and does not require the HARr package.
