Description: HARplus extends the capabilities of GEMPACK `.HAR` and `.SL4` file processing by providing 
    advanced dimension handling, multi-file analysis, and structured metadata management. While inspired 
    by the HARr package, originally developed by Maros Ivanic and his team, HARplus is fully independent 
    and does not require HARr to be installed. It enhances functionality with optimized data extraction, 
    subtotal support, and improved memory efficiency. Designed for large-scale economic modeling workflows, 
    HARplus offers a streamlined and consistent interface for `.HAR` and `.SL4` files.
