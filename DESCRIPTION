Description: HARplus is an R package designed to process and analyze .HAR and .SL4 files, making it easier 
    for GEMPACK users and GTAP model researchers to handle large economic datasets. 
    It simplifies the management of multiple experiment results, enabling faster 
    and more efficient comparisons without complexity. With HARplus, 
    users can extract, restructure, and merge data seamlessly, 
    ensuring compatibility across different tools. 
    The processed data can be exported and used in R, Stata, Python, Julia, or 
    any software that supports .txt, CSV, or Excel formats.
